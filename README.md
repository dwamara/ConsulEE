# consulEE (Consul for JavaEE)

Inspired by SnoopEE, I wanted to have an annotation that could help me register my services in Consul as I had to much boilercode to do it.

consul:\
  serviceId:\
  serviceName:\
  serviceHost: localhost\
  servicePort: 8080\
  serviceTTL: \
  consulHost: localhost\
  consulPort: 8500
